This uses the OvO (one-versus-one) method! We only have a few classifications (the research team), so 
we can get away with using this. OvO MUST BE REPLACED IF WE EVER ADD ADDITIONAL PEOPLE BEYOND 15. 

For example, 100 classifications (people) = 4851 classification pairs and therefore 4851 SVMs (untenable)
